                    • Mr. Musk is taking the opportunity for cross-promotion:
                    The crew members, Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken, will be
                    ferried to the Crew Dragon in a NASA-branded Tesla Model X.

                    <strong>A lot is riding on the launch.</strong> NASA thinks
                    the future of space — at least for low-earth orbit, for now
                    — is chartered flights on private spacecraft,

                    >. If successful, he adds, the flight “promises a whole new
                    world of economic activity in space, with private
                    organizations doing what once required an entire nation,
                    creating new opportunities for experimentation and
                    discovery.”

                    <strong>It looks like a bargain.</strong> The Crew Dragon is
                    the cheapest human-carrying spacecraft yet made for NASA.
                    The agency’s contracts with private companies have fixed

                <h2>Twitter fact-checks Trump</h2>
                <p>
                    For years, the social media service has declined to weigh in
                    on the president’s missives, even when he has spread false
                    information or made threats. That changed yesterday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong
                        >The company added links to two of President Trump’s
                        tweets</strong
                    >, in which he falsely claimed that mail-in ballots could
                    lead to a “rigged” presidential election in November. The
                    text urged readers to “get the facts” about mail-in voting
                    and the links went to information that refutes the
                    president’s claims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Twitter has refused to act before</strong> when
                    critics argued that some Trump tweets violated the service’s
                    policy. And it hasn’t responded to Mr. Trump posting false
                    conspiracy theories about the death of a former aide to Joe
                    Scarborough, despite entreaties from her bereaved husband.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Blowback is likely.</strong> Mr. Trump later
                    tweeted, “Twitter is now interfering in the 2020
                    Presidential Election,” and threatened to respond. His
                    administration is reportedly considering federal reviews of
                    perceived bias against conservative viewpoints on social
                    media. And some of his allies in Congress have called for
                    tech companies to be stripped of broad immunity from
                    liability for content posted on their platforms.

                    <strong>First-quarter earnings were dismal.</strong> Profit
                    per share S&P 500 companies was down about 13 percent in the
                    first three months of the year, the worst slump since 2009.
                    Analysts expect worse to come: a 43 percent fall in the
                    second quarter and 25 percent drop in the third, according
                    to FactSet.

                    • The pandemic makes forecasting difficult, and it doesn’t
                    help that a third of blue-chip companies have withdrawn
                    their financial guidance for 2020.

                    and March, the subsequent rally has pushed the index back to
                    flat for the year. Futures imply another more gains today.

                    • Investors tell Matt that markets “priced in” bad economic
                    news during the earlier decline, and have since positioned
                    themselves for a V-shaped recovery. What’s more likely is
                    that the Fed’s enormous bond-buying programs have pushed
                    debt yields so low that stocks are the best place to seek a
                    return, regardless of how ugly the earnings look.

                    “remote-first” should work: at the office, or mostly remote
                    like everybody else? DealBook readers had a range of
                    opinions — here’s a selection of the responses, lightly
                    edited for clarity and space:

                <p>
                    • “A C.E.O. who does not meet people in person is a captive
                    to the aperture of a camera lens rather than the aperture of
                    her eyesight. All of us who have managed international
                    organizations know how much better we understand remote
                    offices after we have visited them.” —Bill Perlstein, senior

                </p>
                <p>
                    • “The office doesn’t matter for the C.E.O. (who travels a
                    lot anyway) or any other executive. What matters is what
                    they accomplish. If you think about it, the office
                    environment is an expensive artificial structure that
                    enables lots of unnecessary personnel issues. I rarely
                    missed going into the office when I moved from the corporate
                    environment into the entrepreneur world.”—Joe Carlin, Cary,

                    • “As a former director of research at Eastman Kodak, the
                    best ideas came from colleagues talking over coffee or at
                    lunch about some pie in the sky idea or discussing a problem
                    they could not solve.” —Emily Jones, Rochester, N.Y.

                    • “I am an ‘outbound C.E.O.’ That means over 50 percent of
                    my time is spent outside of the office constructing
                    high-value relationships with investors, customers, vendors
                    and strategic partners. Significant growth occurs outside of
                    the office walls. An ‘inbound C.E.O.’ spends over 50 percent
                    of their time in the office and builds value by management
                    of the company processes. In my opinion, this type of C.E.O.
                    should be defined as a C.O.O.”—Steve Baird, executive

                    was essential. I felt responsible for creating a positive
                    work environment and for maintaining a caring office
                    culture. I don’t see how I could have met those objectives
